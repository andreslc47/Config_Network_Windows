# Config_Network_Windows

This Python script is used to switch automatically between wire network and wireless network activation on Windows 10.

1. Install Python 3.8.7
2. Download the file my_net_config.py from this repository
3. In your Windows Desktop, create a direct access to this file. I named this as "CONFIG".
4. Locate the mouse over the direct access and right click on it, Select "Properties" option, Select "Advanced Options" and tick on "Run as Administrator", click in "Accept", then click in "Accept" button.

5. Click on "Yes" to make changes in this Device.
6. Select "CABLE" or "WI-FI" according to what you want for your internet connection.

7. After 2 seconds, the program and all its windows will close automatically.
8. Now, your connection has been quickly switched. This script would be particularly useful when you want to quickly change between these two options or for someone who don't understand well the normal process to do so.
9. Note: When one option is selected, the other option is switched off automatically.
